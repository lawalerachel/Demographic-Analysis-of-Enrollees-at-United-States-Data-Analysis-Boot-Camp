### Objective
The objective of this project is to analyze the demographics of enrollees at a United States data analysis boot camp. By preprocessing raw data, creating visualizations, and deriving insights, the aim is to understand the composition of enrollees, trends over time, and key factors influencing participation.
### Methods
1. Data Preprocessing: Raw data was cleaned to standardize entries, correct inconsistencies, and extract relevant information such as enrollment year and location.
2. Visualization: Utilizing Power BI, a comprehensive dashboard was developed to visualize demographic data including enrollees by state, race/ethnicity, region and year, as well as gender distribution.
3. Analysis and Insights: Key measures and trends were identified through the analysis of enrollment data, focusing on variations in demographics and enrollment patterns over time.
### Key Findings
1. A total of 1000 students enrolled in the boot camp, with a nearly equal distribution between females and males.
2. The Eastern region of the United States accounted for the highest proportion of enrollees, with California having the highest absolute number.
3. Enrollment numbers exhibited an upward trend from 2014 to 2017, indicating growing interest in data analysis education during that period.
### Conclusion
This project provides valuable insights into the demographics and trends of enrollees at the United States data analysis boot camp. Understanding these patterns can inform program development, marketing strategies, and resource allocation for future iterations of the boot camp.
